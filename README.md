# Energy-demand-forecasting-and-optimisation
This project focuses on building an AI/ML-driven system that predicts future energy demand and helps in optimizing energy usage for smart grids, renewable integration, and large-scale infrastructure. The goal is to create an accurate, scalable, and data-driven model that assists power utilities in reducing costs.
